## Mango Tree Question

Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column. So given the tree number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not? Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not.
For referring to the solution check Main.java file.

## Collatz Problem

The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are: If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1 For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
5
16
8
4
2
1
