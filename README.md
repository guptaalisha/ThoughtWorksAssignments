## Mango Tree Question

Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column. So given the tree number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not? Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not.
For referring to the solution check Main.java file.

## Collatz Problem

The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are: If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1 For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:
5
16
8
4
2
1

## Jeevitha's Salary
Jeevitha just started work as a programming trainer for UIT's Placement Cell. She is paid Rs.100 an hour, with a few exceptions. She earns an extra Rs.15 an hour for any part of a day where she works more than 8 hours, and an extra Rs.25 an hour for hours beyond 40 in any one week. Also, she earns a 25% bonus for working on Saturday and a 50% bonus for working on Sunday. The bonuses for Saturday and Sunday are computed based on the hours worked those days; they are not used to calculate any bonus for working more than 40 hours in a week. You'll be given the number of hours Jeevitha worked on each day in a week (Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday), and you need to compute her salary for the week.
