## Mango Tree Question

Dora is interested so much in gardening and she plants more trees in her garden. She plants trees in a rectangular fashion with the order of rows and columns and numbered the trees in row-wise order. She planted the mango tree only in a 1st row, 1st column and last column. So given the tree number, your task is to find whether the given tree is a mango tree or not? Write a program to check whether the given number is a mango tree or not.
For referring to the solution check Main.java file.

## Collatz Problem

The rules for generating Collatz Sequence are: If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1 For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 It has been proved for almost all integers, the repeated application of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends at 1.
Sample Input:
5
Sample Output:

## Jeevitha's Salary
Jeevitha just started work as a programming trainer for UIT's Placement Cell. She is paid Rs.100 an hour, with a few exceptions. She earns an extra Rs.15 an hour for any part of a day where she works more than 8 hours, and an extra Rs.25 an hour for hours beyond 40 in any one week. Also, she earns a 25% bonus for working on Saturday and a 50% bonus for working on Sunday.

## Array Type
Write a program to find the type of array using functions. An array is said to be “Even” if all the elements in the array are even. An array is said to be “Odd” if all the elements in the array are odd. An array is said to be “Mixed” if it contains some odd elements and some even elements. The return value of the function should be 1 if the array is Even. The return value of the function should be 2 if the array is Odd. The return value of the function should be 3 if the array is Mixed.
Sample Input:
5
2
4
1
3
5
Sample Output:
The array is Mixed
 
 ## Array Range
 Write a program to find the range of the elements in the array. The range of an array is the difference between the maximum and minimum element in an array,
Sample Input:
5
2
4
1
3
5
Sample Output:
The range of the array is 4
